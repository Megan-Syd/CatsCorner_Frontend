Cat’s Corner was founded in 1998 by a young man who wanted to dance. Fred Ngo, then a university student in Kingston, Ontario, would make the trip out to Montreal regularly to learn from some of the best swing dancers of the day, then bring those lessons back to Kingston to share with his friends. From this practice, Cat’s Corner Ecole de Danse Swing was born. Since then, it has grown into a vibrant community of people from all corners of the earth, where those same practices of seeking out, learning, and sharing the best jazz around are still at the core of what we do. 

 

Throughout the 25 years of its existence, Cat’s Corner has seen many leaders, and many physical spaces – from Sainte Catherine Street, to the Plateau, to the internet, to the park... But our values of centering community, authenticity, and the music and rhythms of Jazz have not changed. 

 

Jazz dance and music is and has always been an African American tradition. Its roots can be traced back through the history of America, from its present-day influences in R&B and hip-hop, back to the work songs and ring shouts practiced by the enslaved peoples of the Antebellum South, and beyond to its African roots. At Cat’s Corner we strive to keep these origins and their cultural values at the center of what we do. We highlight improvisation, self-expression, autonomy, and community in our classes and our events. We acknowledge those who came before us, who pushed the boundaries of creativity to give us the dances and music that we love.
